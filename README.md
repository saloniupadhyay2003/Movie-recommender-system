# Movie Recommendation System

## Project Overview

This project is a self-learning initiative aimed at gaining hands-on experience with vectorization and cosine similarity concepts. It focuses on building a movie recommendation system that suggests similar movies based on a given selection.

## Features

**Data Pre-processing**: Selection and merging of necessary labels for the model.

**Feature Extraction**: Extracting relevant features from the dataset.

**Vectorization**: Transforming data points into a similarity matrix using cosine similarity.

**Movie Recommendation**: Suggesting the top 5 similar movies for a selected movie.

## Technologies Used

Python

Pandas

NumPy

Scikit-learn

NLP Techniques

## How It Works

1. The dataset is preprocessed by selecting and merging relevant labels.

2. Important features are extracted from the dataset.

3. The dataset is vectorized, converting it into a similarity matrix.

4. When a user selects a movie, the system recommends the top 5 most similar movies based on cosine similarity.
